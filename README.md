# Python Workshop Material

This Python workshop aims to provide a solid introduction to programming in Python. From the basics of how computers work, passing through the basics of Python, and to some of the most useful Python libraries, this workshop offers various tools to understand the whole concept of programming with Python and what can be done with it.

## Complementary information

In the following topics you can find information to complement the workshop.

Please note that there is plenty more information about this topic all over the web. These are just some of the links I consider useful for understanding how things work.

1. Logic and Circuits:<a id="logic-circuits"></a>

## Setup your python workspace

In order to setup everything to start this course, please follow the steps below:

1. If you don't have Python installed in your machine, first download it from the official Python page ([download link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

    **Note:** If you are using MacOS or Linux, it is very likely you'll have it already installed. Nevertheless, you can check it by running the following command on any command prompt:
    
    ```
    python -V
    ```
    If python is installed, it should return something like:
    ```
    Python 3.10.4
    ```

2. Then you will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) or a code editor. You can chose any of your preference, but I would recommend the **Visual Studio Code** code editor ([download link](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)).

    Visual Studio Code features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. Moreover, users can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, preferences, and install extensions that add additional functionalities.

    Some useful extensions for python are:

    - *Python* ([ms-python.python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python))
    
    - *Pylance* ([ms-python.vscode-pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance))
    
    - *IntelliCode* ([VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode))
    
    - *autoDocstring* ([njpwerner.autodocstring](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring))
