"""
1. Build a function that receives a complex number and computes it's 
    conjugate, that is:

    a + bj -> a - bj

    Note: the real and imaginary parts of a complex number z can be 
    obtained as z.real and z.imag respectively.
"""


"""
2. Build a function that receives an integer number and computes it's 
    factorial, that is:
    
    n -> n!

    where n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1
"""


"""
3. Build a function that receives the first name, the last name and the age of
    a person and appends it (add at the end) to a file.

    Note: try to do it without the append mode when opening the file
"""


"""
4. Build a function that receives a list of numbers, an action and other parameters.

    The available actions are:
        - append -> appends an element to the end of the list
                 -> requires the element to be added
        - remove -> removes all instances of the element
                 -> requires the element to be removed
        - sort   -> sorts the list in ascending order
        - reverse sort -> sorts the list in ascending order
        - clear  -> removes all elements of the list

    Depending on the action label, it should perform different actions on the list.
